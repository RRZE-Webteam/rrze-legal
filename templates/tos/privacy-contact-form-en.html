<h2>Contact form and contact by email</h2>

    If a user makes use of this possibility, the data they enter in the input form are
    transmitted to us and stored.
    The contact forms list and explain which data is required. The contact forms indicate if
    there are any deviations from or additions to the principles, purpose and duration of
    storage as presented here.

    The legal basis for the processing of the data transmitted in the course of sending
    an email is Article 6 (1) lit. e DSGVO i.V.m. Art. 4 and 5 BayDSG for the fulfilment
    of the tasks of ยง 5 TMG, Art. 3 para. 1 BayEGovG and ยง 2 BayBITV</p>

<h3>Purpose of data processing</h3>

    The personal data from the input form are processed solely for the purpose of
    contacting the user. If the user contacts us by email, this also constitutes

    Data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for fulfilling the purpose for
    which they were collected. This is the case for the personal data from the input
    template of the contact form and those data sent by email when the respective
    conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is regarded to have ended when it
    can be seen from the circumstances that the subject matter in question has been
    conclusively settled.
